## Author: Md Hasibul Haque Zahid
## Student ID: 2302302
## Overview
This repository contains the benchmarking analysis for various AWS EC2 instances, conducted by Md Hasibul Haque Zahid as part of Cloud Assignment 2.

## Instances Evaluated
- **T2.micro**: Cost-effective with variable CPU performance.
- **C7.medium**: Balanced CPU, memory, and storage resources.
- **M1.small**: Cost-effective and versatile for balanced workloads.

## Benchmarking Results
- **OpenSSL**: C7 Medium excels in RSA 4096-bit encryption.
- **MP3 Encoding**: C7 Medium shows faster MP3 encoding times.
- **Apache Requests**: C7 Medium sustains a higher number of requests per second.
- **Password Cracking**: C7 Medium performs better in password cracking with John the Ripper.

## Learning Outcomes
- Discovered the Phoronix Test Suite for VM performance evaluation.
- Gained insights into AWS's vast array of VM types and their performance/cost implications.

## Challenges & Surprises
- Navigating AWS VM options was intricate and enlightening.
- Setting up the benchmarking environment on Ubuntu Server was challenging but rewarding.
## Report
I have also written a detailed report based on these Project. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the Project.For more information, please refer to the report.

## Conclusion
The C7 Medium instance consistently outperforms T2 Micro and M1 Small across various benchmarks, making it a suitable choice for compute-intensive applications.
